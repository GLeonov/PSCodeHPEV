# PSCodeHPEV
The model implemented the mechanism of co-transcriptional folding in the context of an assemblysome (Shakeel et al, 2017) in which nascent RNAs fold and contact coat-protein as the nucleotides are incorporated by the polymerase. The presented code is an example that was used with the HPeV1-8 circulating strain variants with the publication Leonov et al, 2017.
